**An example on how scene requirements work:**  
- Affection = 8
  - This would mean affection needs to be at least 8 or higher, it does not need to be exactly 8.
- Respect lower than 12
  - This would mean respect absolutely must be lower than 12. It cannot be above 11 or you won't see the scene and will skip to the next scene tier.
