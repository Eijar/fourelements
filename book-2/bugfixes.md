### Changelog:
Fixed the tarven music bug at night in book 2. If you're not OCD you probably didn't even notice it, but it was driving me crazy. Also fixed multiple bugs in the book 2 love route throne room scenes. Many choices gave the wrong points, had the wrong name, etc.

If you know of any small bugs or easy possible QoL changes for **book 1 or the book 2 love route**, feel free to let me know. Just message @ me in [the thread.](https://f95zone.com/threads/four-elements-trainer-v0-6-13e-mity.730/)

### Installation:
Just put it in your game folder. The patch will work with any game version, even future game updates.
