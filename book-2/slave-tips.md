# Four Elements Trainer: Tips & Info

<br>

## Tavern:

#### Serve drinks
- After you flirt with Ty Lee a few times she will offer you a night-shift job at the tavern.

#### Drink with soliders
- The soldiers are only meant to be talked to during certain quests.

#### Flirt with Ty Lee
- Complimenting Ty Lee is required to do her scenes and become her sugar daddy. Once you reach a certain point in the story however, you won't have to use your own money to pay Ty Lee and her scenes will become free.

#### Gamble vs Ty Lee
- Gambling on blackjack isn't an effective or time efficient way to make money, so there's not much reason to play it.

## Armory:
- At the armory you can buy armor for yourself, two troops to help you in battle, and health bonuses for both troops.
- When you buy one of the four armors you are automatically given the health bonus it provides, however you can only have one set of armor equipped at a time. This means it's a good idea to only buy the best armor since previous armors don't give retroactive bonuses, i.e. they are a waste of money. If you save your money during the first few days of the game it's possible to buy the Dragon armor on day 5.
- You can also buy food and slave collars from Mai to give to Lia.

## Farm Mechanics (simple version):
- Use ```Ctrl``` to speed up farm visits/milking  
#1 - Visit the farm every day at night  
#2 - Milk used girls  
#3 - Fuck girls who aren't pregnant  
#4 - Pregnant -> Milk -> Nipples -> Let her cum  
#5 - Leave farm

## Farm Mechanics:
- How do I get more girls?
  - Once you unlock the farm every time you win a battle you get a 50% chance to have a fresh girl added to the farm. You can also buy used girls for $250 at the shop but it's a waste of money, so never buy them.
- How does pregnancy work?
  - 20 days must pass for a pregnant girl to give birth. After a pregnant girl gives birth she becomes a used girl.
- How do Azula visits work?
  - Azula will visit you every 7 days to pay you. If you have 0 pregnant girls when she visits (this should only happen if you don't use the farm at all) she will give you +1 pregnant girls.
- How much do I get paid?
  - 5 coins per milking, 10 coins per birth.
- Why shouldn't I just use the lever to milk the girls?
  - You can double the amount of money you make from the farm by using the method I describe in the simplified farm mechanics. If you just use the lever to milk the girls then: ```milk = used_girls + pregnant_girls``` but if you use the method I discovered then: ```milk = used_girls + used_girls_made_pregnant + (pregnant_girls * 2) + 1```
- What is morality?
  - Morality isn't used in the love route and has no effect on anything in the love route.
