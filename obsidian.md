#### Warning:
- Make sure your game version is at least 0.6.13e, otherwise you won't be able to get all the obsidian.
- Using all the obsidian before upgrading the tavern will prevent you from accepting Quest 7!

## Obsidian Locations:

### Tavern Quests:
- Rewarded for completing Quest 3: Firebender Attack
- Rewarded for completing Quest 7: A Peck of Knowledge

### Maze:
- One obsidian is given to you by Skye when you meet her in the maze
- Follow these steps from the entrance: up, up, right, right; Fight the enemy that spawns then open the chest
- One is found the first time you hide in the wooden crate with the hole the guards use for lewdness
- Two are in the skull at one of the maze's corners
- Two obsidians are found by jizzing on the headless statue's tits in the last section of the maze
